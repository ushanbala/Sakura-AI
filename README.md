# Sakura-AI
Chatgpt inspired AI assistant that provides much much cool stuffs that chatgpt doesn't give you.

# What is Sakura-AI ?
Sakura-AI is inspired by openAI's chatgpt. When I was using the chatgpt client for do some researches , I found out some cool stuffs that would be great for the app. Then, I started building my own application which is Sakura-AI with world's most popular programming language "PYTHON". 

# The application setup - Step 01
Firstly you gotta download the sakura.zip by the releases page or just download it using download zip option in the files section. 

# Step 02
Now extract the zip file in your project field. Then, make sure your computer has a python enviroment. If you don't, just install python by this link: https://www.python.org/ . Then make sure you have installed the "pip".

# Step 03
In the extracted folder, you will see a readme file. Just open it and you will see a pip command there. Just copy and paste it in your terminal(hehe cmd in windows).

# Step 04
Okay, you are good to go now. Go ahead and run the application.Then, you will see the application just like this :)
